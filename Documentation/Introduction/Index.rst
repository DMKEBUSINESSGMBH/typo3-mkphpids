Quote from the Author of PHPIDS:

“PHPIDS (PHP-Intrusion Detection System) is a simple to use, well structured, 
fast and state-of-the-art security layer for your PHP based web application. 
The IDS neither strips, sanitizes nor filters any malicious input, it simply 
recognizes when an attacker tries to break your site and reacts in exactly 
the way you want it to. Based on a set of approved and heavily tested filter 
rules any attack is given a numerical impact rating which makes it easy to 
decide what kind of action should follow the hacking attempt. This could range 
from simple logging to sending out an emergency mail to the development team, 
displaying a warning message for the attacker or even ending the user’s session.


PHPIDS enables you to see who’s attacking your site and how and all without the 
tedious trawling of logfiles or searching hacker forums for your domain. 
Last but not least it’s licensed under the LGPL!”


On their site you can find a collection of resources related to PHPIDS. 
These including files, documentation, a friendly forum and a demo which 
shows some of the best features of PHPIDS.
